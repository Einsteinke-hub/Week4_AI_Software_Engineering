AI-enhanced testing significantly improves test coverage compared to manual testing. While manual testing might cover 10-20 login scenarios in an hour, AI-powered tools can execute hundreds of test variations simultaneously, including edge cases that humans might overlook. The Selenium script above, when integrated with AI plugins, can dynamically generate test data, handle UI changes through element recognition, and parallelize execution across multiple environments. AI tools like Testim.io use machine learning to maintain test stability despite UI changes, reducing maintenance overhead by 60-70%. This automation enables continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines, catching regressions immediately while freeing human testers for exploratory and usability testing. The result is comprehensive test coverage with faster feedback cycles and reduced time-to-market.
